Developing an ordering management system to optimize the work efficiency and overall workflow at BlueBox.

## Definition of the Product

Ordering management systems in restaurants have a huge impact on efficiency and workflow.
The local student center BlueBox contains a bar managed by students.
As the current operating system is only a website sending unorganized orders to the printer behind the bar counter, our project idea is to optimize this process for a better overview and smoother workflow for the staff.

This will be achieved by an application running on a device like a tablet, located at the bar counter. The customer will still access the ordering website via QR-code on his table.
The benefits of digitalizing the system lay primarily in an optimized overview for orders in general, but also by providing extra information like waiting time.
